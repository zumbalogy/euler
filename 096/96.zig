// Su Doku (Japanese for 'number place') is the name of a popular puzzle.
// Its origin is unclear but Leonhard Euler invented a similar, harder,
// puzzle called Latin Squares.
//
// The goal of Su Doku is to replace the blanks (or zeros) in a 9x9 grid in
// such that each row, column, and 3x3 box contains each of the digits 1-9.
//
// A proper Su Doku puzzle has a unique solution and is solvable by logic,
// although it may be necessary to employ "guess and test" methods.
//
// The file sudoku.txt contains 50 Su Doku puzzles ranging in difficulty.
// Find the sum of the 3-digit numbers in the top left corner of each solution.
