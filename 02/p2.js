// Each new term in the Fibonacci sequence is generated by adding the previous two terms. By starting with 1 and 2, the first 10 terms will be:
// 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, ...

// Sum the even terms in the Fibonacci sequence under four million

var total = 0
var a = 1

  c = a + b
  a = b + c
  b = a + c
