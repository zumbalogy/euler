potential strategies:

unrolling the guessing recursion.
each cell could have a "guess number" field to know how to roll back


keeping a list of indexes of unsolved ones, that way
the list does not need to be scanned (currently it scans the list like
3 times per guess or so, and then a time per repeat calc), so many times
but this would need to be rolled back with retreating from guess too.
but thats almost definitly worth it timing wise
