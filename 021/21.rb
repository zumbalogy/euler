# Let d(n) equal the sum of divisors of n.

# If d(a) = b and d(b) = a and a â‰  b, then a and b are amicable.

# The divisors of 220 are 1, 2, 4, 5, 10, 11, 20, 22, 44, 55 and 110; so d(220) = 284.
# The divisors of 284 are 1, 2, 4, 71 and 142; so d(284) = 220.

# Sum all amicable numbers under 10_000.
