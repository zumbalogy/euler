; The sequence of triangle numbers is generated by adding the natural numbers.
; The 7th triangle number would be 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7 = 28.

; The first ten: 1, 3, 6, 10, 15, 21, 28, 36, 45, 55, ...

; Listing the factors of the first seven triangle numbers:
;  1: 1
;  3: 1,3
;  6: 1,2,3,6
; 10: 1,2,5,10
; 15: 1,3,5,15
; 21: 1,3,7,21
; 28: 1,2,4,7,14,28

; 28 is the first triangle number to have over five divisors.
; What is the first triangle number to have over five hundred divisors?
